# Project Movies

This project was made by Karolim Mann and Rosanna Dahlberg during week 12 of Technigos 24 week bootcamp.

The goal for this week was to use themoviedb.org's API to fetch a list of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie. And also practice how to use React router to create multi-page applications and combining useState with useEffect.

## The problem

We began to make two components, one for the PopoularList with movies and one named Details withpage. In our PopularList components we fetch the API with movies playing now.

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
